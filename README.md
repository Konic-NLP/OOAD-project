# OOAD-project
**A course project repo for CSCI5832**. <br>
**Group member**: Sijia Ge, Xiaosong Wang, and Zhiyong Wang.<br>
Version:1.0 <br>
To make the code run, we adopt the belowing changes/modifications:<br>
1. The conditions of items are integers from 1 to 5 inclusively. The correspond relation is {Poor:1, Fair:2, Good:3, Very Good:4, Excellent:5}.
2. The price of items is an integer. When the price is changed 1.1 times or 0.9 times, the (int) method is applied to truncate the float.
3. If the order is delivered on Sunday, when the store is closed, the staff, who is on duty, will put items of the order in the inventory on Monday.
